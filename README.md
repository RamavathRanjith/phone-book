This code is a C++ program that implements a Phone Directory class. The Phone Directory class has a private member variable head which is a pointer to a Contact structure. The Contact structure contains three members: name, phoneNumber, and next. The Phone Directory class has a constructor and a destructor. The constructor initializes the head pointer to nullptr and the destructor deletes all contacts in the phone directory. The Phone Directory class also has five public member functions: addContact, deleteContact, displayContacts, searchContact, and deleteAllContacts. The addContact function adds a contact to the phone directory, the deleteContact function deletes a contact from the phone directory, the displayContacts function displays all contacts in the phone

A node is used in this code to store the data for each contact in the phone directory. The Contact structure is used to create a node, which contains the name and phone number of a contact, as well as a pointer to the next node in the list. The Phone Directory class uses a linked list of these nodes to store and manage the contacts in the phone directory.
